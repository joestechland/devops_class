Review progress so far:
  - Create working linux vm to use as ansible control - can run VSC, git and can use with OIC later
  - Execucte ad hoc commands
  - Create and use inventory file and cfg file
  - Created first playbook
New:
Steps to creating a new playbook (pseudo steps first)
Goal: create user oracle, add ssh key, add to sudoers file, install java jdk
- starter.yml - > init.yml
- replace comments with plays 
- Add vars: vars_file and inline - syntax (when to use "") 
modules: lineinfile, authorized keys, file, copy, user, yum, command
Conditionals - use of when and proper access to complex data - records and dictionaries in python.

If time: reuse playbooks and split into and use roles.
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse.html#re-using-files-and-roles
Ansible offers four distributed, re-usable artifacts: variables files, task files, playbooks, and roles.

        A variables file contains only variables.

        A task file contains only tasks.

        A playbook contains at least one play, and may contain variables, tasks, and other content. You can re-use tightly focused playbooks, but you can only re-use them statically, not dynamically.

        A role contains a set of related tasks, variables, defaults, handlers, and even modules or other plugins in a defined file-tree. Unlike variables files, task files, 
        or playbooks, roles can be easily uploaded and shared via Ansible Galaxy. See Roles for details about creating and using roles.



    import tasks will be parsed at the beginning when you run your playbook
    include tasks will be parsed at the moment Ansible hits them
