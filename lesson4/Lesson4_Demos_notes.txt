Review progress so far:
  - Create working linux vm to use as ansible control - can run VSC, git and can use with OIC later
  - Execucte ad hoc ommands
  - Create and use inventory file and cfg file
  - Created first playbook
New:
Steps to creating a new playbook (pseudo steps first)
Inventory with multiple groups
vars, use in playbook, syntax (when to use "") and var files
modules: lineinfile, authorized keys, file, copy, user, yum, command
Conditionals - use of when and proper access to complex data - records and dictionaries in python.

Goal: create user oracle, add ssh key, add to sudoers file, iinstall java jdk

If time: resuse playbooks and split into and use roles.
