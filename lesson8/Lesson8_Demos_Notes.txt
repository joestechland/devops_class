Last week:
Import and include
Create and use Roles

1. Solve last week's class problem: 
How to prevent "Make sure Apache is started now and at boot." from running if
apache is not installed?

starter.yml
2 ways: 
1. use when to check if output of registered var contains "not installed" or "Removed"
- if both are true - then httpd is present
can write with "and" or on spearate lines as part of list
2. Use package_facts to get list of packages installed

BUT: what if you want this same condition for more than one play? (Make sure apache started AND open port?
    use Block - all items under/within a block inherit block-level directives (become, when, etc) 

    All tasks in a block inherit directives applied at the block level. 
    Most of what you can apply to a single task (with the exception of loops) can be applied at the block level,
    So blocks make it much easier to set data or directives common to the tasks. 
    The directive does not affect the block itself, it is only inherited by the tasks enclosed by a block. For example, a when statement is applied to the tasks within a block, not to the block itself.


2. Changed_when
Defining “changed”

Ansible lets you define when a particular task has “changed” a remote node using the changed_when conditional. 
This lets you determine, based on return codes or output, 
whether a change should be reported in Ansible statistics and whether a handler should be triggered or not. 

Annoying issue:
some module and Command and Shell report changes even if nothing actually 
use changed_when to control Ansible reporting when something actually changes
ex: create user - shows changed even if user alre4ady exists/is not created
so: register var and check if it shows " present"  - use changed_when 

or  date command:
   - name: Check the current system date.
      command: date
      register: date
 #     changed_when: date.stdout == "foo"

    - name: Print the current system date.
      debug:
        var: date.stdout

3. Error Handling
Can use ignore_errors: true 
if a task fails and that's ok and you want to continue anyway (makes ure that that's ok!) 
ex: starter.yml Make sure Apache is started now and at boot. - can use ignore_errors: true instead of when

fail_when if output writes to stderr  or use rc (return code) == 0 

Can also force a fail to occur when a conditon is (or is not ) met:
- name: Example using fail and when together
  fail:
    msg: The system may not be provisioned according to the CMDB status.
  when: cmdb_status != "to-be-staged"

Sometimes you have to wait a period of time before continuing with the next play:
ex: (re)starting a service or even a server
ansible.builtin.wait_for – Waits for a condition before continuing
examples:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/wait_for_module.html


4. Reuse: Templates
To create a structured file and fill in vars - possibly different per host or other condition w/out having to generate the file itself
ex: instructions to students -  a text file and certain values - localhost name, username, password, must be filled in when the file is created. 
Posibly with values created, discivered or generated at config time
for simple files, one can use lineinfile module.

Like a mail merge - you can put vars direclty into the template and these will be replaced when the template module play runs: 
ex:
  - name: Add Apache virtualhost for Drupal.
  template:
    src: "templates/drupal.test.conf.j2"
    dest: "/etc/apache2/sites-available/{{ domain }}.test.conf"
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644
  notify: restart apache

templates/drupal.test.conf.j2:
  <VirtualHost*:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost 
  ServerName {{ domain }}.test 
  ServerAlias www.{{ domain }}.test 
  DocumentRoot {{ drupal_core_path }}/web 
  <Directory "{{ drupal_core_path }}/web">
          Options FollowSymLinks Indexes
          AllowOverride All
      </Directory>
  </VirtualHost>
when Ansible reaches the play that copies this template into place, 
the Jinja template will have the variable names replaced with the values /var/www/drupal and drupal (or whatever values you’d like!).
Ex:
 #  The path where Drupal will be downloaded and installed.
 drupal_core_path:"/var/www/drupal"

 #  The resulting domain will be[domain].test(with.test appended).
 domain:"drupal"



Import Tasks/Playbooks, Use of Roles
Import tasks and use custom vars:
import_tasks: create_user.yml
    vars:
        crete_group: joe
        create_user: joe

import_tasks: create_user.yml
    vars:
        create_group: ben
        create_user: ben

Use a role from ansible-galaxy/github:

https://github.com/gantsign/ansible-role-maven


Using Roles and vars:
ex: create_user - defaults to oracle
but can override within the play

Also, if running script locally on machine it is on then can use connection=local and is much faster and does not need any keys
connection: local

Next Week:
  - get started with OUIT scripts: set up env (clone repo, VSC/terminal and extensions)
  - Analyze one and start to build one need a new env for upcongi java on oci course:
      - provision new OCI compute (2 cpu, OEL 7)
      - update yum, new user: oracle, add to sudoer, gkrellm, java jdk 16 + env vars, derby db, jmeter, maven, intellij, docker, minikube, kubectl, jenkins, clone repo for course, labs files
