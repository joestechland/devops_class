Gather facts:
The filter option filters only the first level subkey below ansible_facts.

Env Vars: using inline to create env var entries

Handlers: starter.yml:
    restart / re-enable apache and firewalld to see handlers run

  Reuse in Ansible: 
    Ansible offers four distributed, re-usable artifacts: variables files, task files, playbooks, and roles.
        A variables file contains only variables.
        A task file contains only tasks.
        A playbook contains at least one play, and may contain variables, tasks, and other content. You can re-use tightly focused playbooks, 
            but you can only re-use them statically, not dynamically.
        A role contains a set of related tasks, variables, defaults, handlers, and even modules or other plugins in a defined file-tree. 
        Unlike variables files, task files, or playbooks, roles can be easily uploaded and shared via Ansible Galaxy. 
            Ansible Galaxy refers to the Galaxy website, a free site for finding, downloading, and sharing community developed roles.

    Split Conditional into separate playbooks:
        Display server info, test conditionals, do string manipulation
        "Refactor" the larger playbook into smaller playbooks/taks/roles and call them from the main_conditional.yml
        1. Create main_conditional.yml
        1. Refactor server info into a set of reusble tasks:
            import print_server.yml
        2. Ref

        For dynamic re-use, add an include_* task in the tasks section of a play:
            include_role
            include_tasks
            include_vars

        For static re-use, add an import_* task in the tasks section of a play:
            import_role
            import_tasks
        Importing roles, tasks, or playbooks adds them to a playbook statically. Ansible pre-processes imported files and roles before it runs any tasks in a playbook, 
        so imported content is never affected by other tasks within the top-level playbook.
        You can pass variables to imports. You must pass variables if you want to run an imported file more than once in a playbook. For example:
        tasks:
        - import_tasks: wordpress.yml
        vars:
            wp_user: timmy

        - import_tasks: wordpress.yml
        vars:
            wp_user: alice

        - import_tasks: wordpress.yml
        vars:
            wp_user: bob

Can add tags to imports/includes
    - name: Import this is playbook.
        import_playbook: listofplays.yml
      tags:
        - import

    Split into two playbooks and call them from a main.yml
    - move create user out to separate task list
    - Import playbooks - demo ubuntu_devops/Developer playbooks
    - How are vars handled when using import and role s- overrding vars and default (Ranjitha Q previous week)
     Import vs Include and use of vars to override values - different values in different playbooks/tasks

    https://www.ansiblejunky.com/blog/ansible-101-include-vs-import/
    import tasks will be parsed at the beginning when you run your playbook = STATIC
    include tasks will be parsed at the moment Ansible hits them = DYNAMIC (ex: syntax errros not encoiuntered until include code is executed, noty at first parse like import
    *** Tags applied to the incliud ITSELF not the contaned taks, p,like IMPORT)


Roles:
An Ansible role has a defined directory structure with eight main standard directories. You must include at least one of these directories in each role. You can omit any directories the role does not use. For example:

        # playbooks
        site.yml
        webservers.yml
        fooservers.yml
        roles/
            common/
                tasks/
                handlers/
                library/
                files/
                templates/
                vars/
                defaults/
                meta/
            webservers/
                tasks/
                defaults/
                meta/

    By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content (also main.yaml and main):

You can create this manually or - better - with ansible-galaxy:

    cd roles
    ansible-galaxy init test-role-1


        tasks/main.yml - the main list of tasks that the role executes.
        handlers/main.yml - handlers, which may be used within or outside this role.
        library/my_module.py - modules, which may be used within this role (see Embedding modules and plugins in roles for more information).
        defaults/main.yml - default variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information). These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden by any other variable, including inventory variables.
        vars/main.yml - other variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information).
        files/main.yml - files that the role deploys.
        templates/main.yml - templates that the role deploys.
        meta/main.yml - metadata for the role, including role dependencies.

        The classic (original) way to use roles is with the roles option for a given play:
        ---
        - hosts: webservers
        roles:
            - common
            - webservers

        When you use the roles option at the play level, for each role ‘x’:

            If roles/x/tasks/main.yml exists, Ansible adds the tasks in that file to the play.
            If roles/x/handlers/main.yml exists, Ansible adds the handlers in that file to the play.
            If roles/x/vars/main.yml exists, Ansible adds the variables in that file to the play.
            If roles/x/defaults/main.yml exists, Ansible adds the variables in that file to the play.
            If roles/x/meta/main.yml exists, Ansible adds any role dependencies in that file to the list of roles.
            Any copy, script, template or include tasks (in the role) can reference files in roles/x/{files,templates,tasks}/ 
            (dir depends on task) without having to path them relatively or absolutely.

        Convert conditionals.yml to imported taks and playbooks, then roles.
        LOok in split_conditional
            notice import playbooks and tasks
            notice roles/ dir 
            cd roles
                ansible-galaxy init name_of_role
                - creates "boilerplate/scaffolding" for full roles and dirs with empty main.yml for tqasks, vars, handlers, meta...
