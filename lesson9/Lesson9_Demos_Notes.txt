DO have to run package_facts - but do not have to register separate var - it creates ansible_facts.packages

Start working with OCI 
Two parts: 
Provison and purge in OCI
Run script to configure compute image for course

We'll look at part 2 first.
1. Clone Ansible_Playbook repo locally
2. Open repo in VSC and find my desired Playbook
3. Make copy of playbook ( we'll cover branches in Git later) to be used with new course build
4. Use vagrant to make local vm for testing.
5. Set up ssh to log into vm - ssh-copy-id for keys
6. Open terminal and ssh in 
7. 

1. Setup Control machine for OCI CLI & ansible OCI modules
2. Begin working with OUIT OCI ocic_scripts
3. Clone (or at least edit) ed-devops Ansible Scripts repo

Provision and Configure a new OUIT OCI Env - Build and purge from scratch
