Last Week:
    Var syntax  - vartester.yml
    Conditionals from data in complex outputs/registered variables + Msg syntax for output - conditionals.yml
    Python string manipulation
    If you have a large playbook, it may be useful to run only specific parts of it instead of running the entire playbook. 
    You can do this with Ansible tags. Using tags to execute or skip selected tasks is a two-step process:
        Add tags to your tasks, either individually or with tag inheritance from a block, play, role, or import.
        Select or skip tags when you run your playbook.
        https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html#using-tags
    Use of -v/vvv and callback_whitelist=profile_tasks for monitoring performace and pipelinging=true for increased speed.
