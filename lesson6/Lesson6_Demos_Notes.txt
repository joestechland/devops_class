Last Week:
    Var syntax  - vartester.yml
    Conditionals from data in complex outputs/registered variables + Msg syntax for output - conditionals.yml
    Python string manipulation
    If you have a large playbook, it may be useful to run only specific parts of it instead of running the entire playbook. 
    You can do this with Ansible tags. Using tags to execute or skip selected tasks is a two-step process:
        Add tags to your tasks, either individually or with tag inheritance from a block, play, role, or import.
        Select or skip tags when you run your playbook.
        https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tags.html#using-tags
    Use of -v/vvv and callback_whitelist=profile_tasks for monitoring performace and pipelinging=true for increased speed.

This Week:
    "Register" var for setup not needed
    Gather-Facts done by default 
        - can be disdbaled with garther_facts:false
        https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html
        Can filter what will be collected - by key and by host - use setup module
        To see the ‘raw’ information as gathered, run this command at the command line:
            ansible.builtin.setup
            *** So - setup only used to filter what is gathered (Thanks to Russ for the Q)

    joy of weakly typed languages - a = 3;  Q: Does yamllint or ansible lint catch this?
    Env Vars and setting the Environment during playbook execution and permanently
        See starter.yml  - Set environment vars - read file and extract values - like env var value
    Complete starter.yml w/ adding httpd
    Use of handlers to restart server or reload daemon
    Split into two playbooks and call them from a main.yml
    - move create user out to separate task list
    - Import playbooks - demo ubuntu_devops/Developer playbooks
    - How are vars handled when using import and role s- overrding vars and default (Ranjitha Q previous week)
     Import vs Include and use of vars to override values - different values in different playbooks/tasks
    Create basic role with separated playbooks, add /vars folder and /files folder
    Combine ubuntu_devops_developer palybooks and code for either ubuntu or Centos and virtualbox or vmware
